Shareable thoughts on these different concepts


When talking about cell types, at least four concepts are discernible, with different meanings and implications:

1. Clustering: Grouping a sample of observations of cells so as to discern groups of similar observations
2. Classification: Reporting classes of cells that share something in common. Crafting a new type, a new theoretical class that has instances in the real world and predictive values
3. Naming: Choosing a name for this previously reported class of cells
4. Definition: Delimiting a classification of cells so as to be able to identify them later
5. Identification: The assignment of cells in experiments to previously defined classes. 


The four _words_ used above are not, however, used to express only one of those meanings. 

They are more often than not mixed in the literature. 


Here, I argue there is a benefit on converging on a common and precise vocabulary, to avoid confusion and streamline research. 

In special in the context of the cell atlas. 

1. Clustering
  Performing unsupervised clustering is a way to analyze a dataset. It is about _observations_, but does not say anything about the external world, about the rest of reality. 
  Clustering can be a basis for classification (2).
  Clustering can be used as an heuristic to assign _observations_ in a dataset to classes of cells. 
  
 2. Classification
   Claiming that there are cells generally, in the world, that share some kind of similarity. That are a part of a common class. 
   Looking at clusters, a researcher may hypothesize that in other samples, other cells may share the same characteristics. 
   Technically, a class is expected to have _instances_, individuals in the real world that can be assign to this class. 
   In an analogy to taxonomy, clustering is collecting and describing a set samples. Classification is concluding  from those samples that there is a new species.
   
   
3. Definition
  It is possible to craft a class without an specific definition.
  An undefined class does not have clear, discernible ways of finding its instances in the world. 
  A definition, thus, is the process of setting the limits, the boundaries of a class.
  
  This meaning is very close to
